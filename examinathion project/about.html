                     My name is Eva, and cooking for me is more than just cooking. It is creativity, inspiration and the opportunity to share knowledge. In 10 years of experience, I have gone from a hobby to a real calling - to teach others.  I had my own pastry shop, worked in various cafes, restaurants, and even a confectionery factory. I also participated in the creation of kitchens for several turnkey pastry shops. What started as an interesting experiment has now become a whole world of flavors, techniques, and endless possibilities. At Soul & Spice 138, we are passionate about combining traditional flavors with modern technology to create unique culinary experiences. I am committed to helping you discover the secrets of fine dining, whether you are a beginner or an experienced chef. Join us to explore our world of exquisite recipes and innovative cooking techniques.
