        <h2>About learning</h2>
        <p>There won't be enticing phrases here about how my online school is the best and most productive, and that you're only here, that only I will teach you how to make smooth cakes, unusual breakfasts and the most delicious dishes. No.
            This is a team effort! And without your participation, hard work and determination nothing will work. It's not enough to watch a video, it's not enough to read the recipe and the theoretical part. 
            Only daily practice will help to strive for perfection. Hands sometimes remember much better than the head. I, in turn, promise to be a good friend, a loving teacher and a strict critic.
